        About JirehFaith
      </h1>

      <p>
        At Jireh Faith, we believe that when life speaks — in joy, in sorrow, in fear,
        or in gratitude — the most powerful response comes from God’s Word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rooted in the promise of Jehovah Jireh — “The Lord will provide” (Genesis 22:14)
        — JirehFaith is a prayer companion designed to bring Scripture into your everyday
        circumstances. Whether you are seeking peace in moments of anxiety, strength in times
        of trial, or a voice of thanksgiving in seasons of blessing, JirehFaith helps guide
        your prayers through the living Word of God.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To provide personalized, Scripture-based prayers that meet people where they are,
        offering comfort, encouragement, and hope — all while pointing back to the eternal
        faithfulness of God.
